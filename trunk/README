To use these scripts, you should install the following programs first:
debhelper cdbs gdebi

=============================================
The important scripts in this directory:

make_binary_package.sh
	for producing a .deb package for use on your own system

make_source_package.sh
	for producing a .deb source package to submit to the Ubuntu repos

clean_source_package.sh
	Gets rid of the crud produced by the other two scripts
